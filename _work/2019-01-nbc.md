	<p>
		At NBCUniversal I created user-centered solutions and interactive concepts for the TV Everywhere product team. My work touched internal partners (your favorite channels, probably) such as <strong>Bravo</strong>, <strong>USA</strong>, <strong>SYFY</strong>, and many others.
	</p>

	<p>
		This meant creating a single source of truth design system for Fire TV that scaled to the needs of 6 brands. It was robust enough to deliver quick iterative design changes for project managers while maintaining consistent redline specs for engineers.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition to creating design systems, I created product vision specifications for exploratory interactions on new ways to watch streaming content.
